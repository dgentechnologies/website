/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for the DGEN Technologies website.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes ease of access for public content (blog posts) and
 * allows any user to submit a contact form message, while restricting access
 * to sensitive data to a specific admin user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Blog posts are stored in `/blogPosts/{postId}`.
 * - Contact messages are stored in `/contactMessages/{messageId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Blog posts are publicly readable and writable for prototyping.
 * - Any user (authenticated or anonymous) can create a contact message.
 * - Only the designated admin can read contact messages.
 * - Modifying or deleting contact messages is denied to all client-side users.
 * - Server-side access (via Admin SDK) is implicitly allowed and bypasses these rules.
 *
